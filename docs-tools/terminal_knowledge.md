# Terminal Client Setup & Command Line Reflections

## Terminal Client Choice

- **Windows Terminal + PowerShell**
- Chosen for its modern UI, tab support, and deep integration with Windows.

## Customizations

- Applied a dark theme for better readability.
- Set up a few aliases (e.g., `ll` for `Get-ChildItem`).
- Enabled line numbers and adjusted font size for comfort.

## Most Useful Command Learned

- `Get-ChildItem` (alias: `ls`): Lists files and directories in the current location. Very useful for navigating the file system quickly.
