## âœ… Reflection

- **What is the purpose of a module in NestJS?**
  - To group related components and organize the application structure.
- **How does a controller differ from a provider?**
  - Controller handles HTTP requests; provider contains business logic and can be injected.
- **Why is dependency injection useful in NestJS?**
  - It decouples components, making code more modular, testable, and maintainable.
- **How does NestJS ensure modularity and separation of concerns?**
  - By organizing code into modules, controllers, and providers, each with a clear responsibility.
