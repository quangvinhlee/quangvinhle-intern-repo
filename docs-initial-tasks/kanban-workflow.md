## 📝 Reflection

### ✅ How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban surfaces team workload clearly. When WIP is limited and tasks are visualized, it’s easier to spot when the team or individual is overloaded. This helps team leads or PMs reprioritize work, and it helps individuals stay focused without juggling too many tasks.

### ✅ How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

As a **Backend Developer Intern**, I can improve my workflow by:

- Regularly updating my task status
- Avoiding picking up multiple tasks at once
- Collaborating with teammates when I'm blocked
- Breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable cards
