## üìù Reflection

### ‚úÖ When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?

Use AI:

- When you need quick examples, templates, or clarification
- To automate routine or repetitive tasks
- As a second opinion or brainstorming partner

Rely on your own skills:

- When making architectural decisions or security-sensitive implementations
- When accuracy, clarity, or performance is critical
- When AI‚Äôs suggestions seem uncertain or outdated

---

### ‚úÖ How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?

- Treat AI suggestions as **starting points**, not final answers
- Regularly read and write code without AI to deepen understanding
- Limit AI use in interviews, tests, or code reviews
- Use AI to explore ideas but always validate with documentation or real-world testing

---

### ‚úÖ What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?

- Never copy internal code or secrets into public AI tools
- Use company-approved tools only (e.g., GitHub Copilot with enterprise settings)
- Ask for clarification from a supervisor if unsure
- Follow Focus Bear‚Äôs internal data handling and AI usage policy
