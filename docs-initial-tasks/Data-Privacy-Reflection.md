## 📝 Reflection

### 🔐 What steps can I take to handle data securely?

While reading the policy, I realized how much responsibility we have over user data even things that feel small like a habit name or an email address. One step I’ll take is being more mindful before sharing screenshots or internal links. I'll always check whether the content contains anything user-related before sharing it in Slack or Notion.

### 📂 How should I store, share, and dispose of sensitive information?

For storage, I’ll make sure all files I save are either on Google Drive with proper sharing permissions or deleted if not needed. I usually keep things in Downloads or Desktop, but now I’ll make sure to clean those up regularly. I’ll also start using password-protected notes for anything sensitive if I need to write it down temporarily.

### ❌ Common mistakes I should avoid

Honestly, I’ve sometimes reused passwords or stored login details in my browser. After learning more, I plan to move everything to a proper password manager and enable 2FA where possible. Another mistake I’ve seen is using public Wi-Fi without a VPN. I’ll make sure to avoid that too when working remotely.

## 🛠️ Task

### ✅ Habit I will adopt:

> Every Friday, I will review my digital workspace for any data that should be deleted or better secured.

### ✅ Key learning I will implement:

> Even small bits of metadata like “habit titles” can be sensitive when AI is involved. I’ll avoid putting user-specific or personal context in any prompts or notes passed to AI tools.
