## What makes Focus Bear different?

Focus Bear is the only one here that blends **AI-powered, multi-device distraction blocking** with habit-building tools. It doesn’t just block you get:

- Scheduled day plans and morning routines
- Follow-along videos (like guided stretches or exercises)
- Punctuality reminders and wellbeing check-ins

Freedom and Cold Turkey are great at straight-up blocking. Freedom is more about flexible scheduling and blocking across devices, while Cold Turkey is famous for its ultra-restrictive “no-way-out” lock modes.  
Tiimo and Routinery are focused on planning and habit timelines, but their distraction blocking is weak compared to Focus Bear.

So, Focus Bear’s “thing” is being an all-in-one: blocking distractions smartly **and** guiding your routines.

## If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

I’d choose Focus Bear if I wanted **everything in one app** habit building, AI-powered distraction blocking, break reminders, and guided routines.  
Freedom and Cold Turkey are solid if all I need is blocking, but they won’t help me wake up on time, stretch, or stick to a morning plan.  
Tiimo and Routinery are great at visualizing routines, but they’d still leave me open to drifting into YouTube or Instagram. Focus Bear ties all of it together.

## What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

- **Freedom**: Built-in ambient sound library to set the mood for focus.
- **Tiimo**: Extremely visual, timeline-based UI for daily routines.
- **Routinery**: Habit streaks and gamification that make routines feel rewarding.

## Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

Adding **ambient sound** could really level up the focus experience. I personally like having background noise rain sounds, coffee shop chatter, white noise, even light music depending on my mood and task.  
Right now, I might use Freedom just for its sound library while using Focus Bear for everything else. If Focus Bear built that in, I wouldn’t need two apps.

## Personal improvement suggestions from testing

- Some tabs still take a while to load, could be optimized for speed.
- In **Super Strict Mode**, when running it for the first time, it should show a **confirmation modal** before starting.
- Improve UI for habits, make it smoother and more engaging.
- Habit videos should **auto-play immediately** when the user arrives, without needing to press play.
- Break mode currently isn’t working properly, needs fixing so breaks start and end as intended.
