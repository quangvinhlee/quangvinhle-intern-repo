## üìù Reflection

### ‚úÖ What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

**Currently following:**

- Using unique passwords and a password manager (Bitwarden)
- Enabling 2FA on most work accounts
- Locking my devices when idle

**Areas to improve:**

- Double-checking URLs in messages/emails before clicking
- Being more alert to phishing-style messages on Slack or email
- Reviewing access permissions regularly (e.g., GitHub, Google Docs)

---

### ‚úÖ How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?

- Use a checklist when setting up new tools
- Keep security top of mind by integrating it into daily routines (e.g., always locking the screen when stepping away)
- Take 5 seconds to pause before clicking on any external link or download
- Remind teammates if you see unsafe practices (e.g., sharing passwords in plain text)

---

### ‚úÖ What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

- Continue using a password manager and review stored credentials monthly
- Enable 2FA on all critical accounts (including GitHub, email, Notion)
- Avoid using browser-saved passwords
- Change any weak or reused passwords

---

### ‚úÖ What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

- **Immediately change** the affected account's password
- **Enable or review 2FA** settings
- **Notify** my manager or the designated security contact at Focus Bear
- **Document** what happened and help investigate if needed
