# Company Reflection – Focus Bear

## Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
I think Focus Bear was made by people who know what it’s like to struggle with staying on track, especially if you have ADHD or Autism. They probably tried other apps but found they didn’t really help with building habits or stopping distractions in a realistic way. So they made something that actually works for them and others in the same boat.

## What problem is Focus Bear solving?
It’s helping with a few big problems:
- Getting distracted all the time by websites, apps, or phone notifications.
- Not having a consistent routine, especially in the mornings.
- Forgetting to take breaks and burning out.
- Having to constantly decide what to do next, which gets exhausting.

## Why do you think this mission is important?
These days it’s way too easy to lose focus, and for people who already find it hard to concentrate, it’s even worse. Having a tool that helps you stick to habits, block distractions, and remind you to take breaks can make a huge difference for both mental health and productivity. It’s not just about working more — it’s about working in a healthy way.

## How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?
I like that Focus Bear is about building good habits and protecting your focus without making you feel bad for slipping up. It’s built with empathy, backed by research, and it tries to make life easier instead of more complicated. I’m into tech that actually helps people and doesn’t just push them to work harder non-stop.

## Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
Yeah, for sure. I get distracted easily, sometimes forget to take breaks, and my mornings can be all over the place. The idea of having something guide me through routines and block distractions across all my devices sounds really useful.
