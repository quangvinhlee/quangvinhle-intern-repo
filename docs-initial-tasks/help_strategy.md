# Reflection: Troubleshooting Strategies – AI, Google, or Colleagues?

## When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?

I prefer using AI tools when I need quick, context-aware answers, code generation, or explanations tailored to my current problem. AI is especially helpful for:

- Getting code snippets or debugging suggestions directly in my IDE
- Clarifying concepts or error messages without sifting through multiple web pages
- Exploring alternative approaches or best practices

I turn to Google when:

- I need official documentation, community discussions, or troubleshooting for rare errors
- Searching for solutions to very specific stack traces or library issues
- Looking for broader context, tutorials, or comparing multiple sources

## How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?

I ask a colleague when:

- The problem is specific to our codebase, infrastructure, or team processes
- I’ve tried AI and Google but still feel stuck or unsure about the impact of a change
- The issue might affect others, or I need a second opinion on design decisions
- Collaboration could save time or prevent misunderstandings

## What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?

Troubleshooting alone can lead to:

- Wasted time on rabbit holes or misdiagnosed issues
- Missing out on team knowledge or past solutions
- Overlooking subtle bugs or edge cases
- Feeling isolated or frustrated, especially with complex or urgent problems

Balancing self-reliance with collaboration and leveraging the right tools helps developers solve problems more efficiently and learn from each experience.
