## 📝 Reflection

### ✅ What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

**My Role: Backend Developer Intern**  
I support the backend team by contributing to APIs, database schemas, and server-side logic. I help implement features, fix bugs, and ensure data is handled securely and efficiently. My work directly supports delivering working software and smooth user experiences.

### ✅ How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

I frequently collaborate with:

- **Frontend Developers**, to align on API contracts and data requirements.
- **QA**, to ensure backend features are tested and function properly.
- **Product Managers**, to understand the purpose behind the features I’m building.

Our responsibilities overlap when planning features, debugging issues, or refining technical scope.
