# 🧘 OHS Laptop Ergonomics Reflection

## 📝 My Reflections

### 🧩 Equipment changes I made:

Before this task, I was using my laptop directly on the desk, which made me hunch over without realizing. After learning about the risks, I added a **laptop stand** to bring the screen to eye level and started using an **external keyboard and mouse**. This setup feels much better already. I can sit more upright and my wrists feel less strained.

### 💡 Behavioural changes I’m making:

I've started sitting with a more upright posture and taking **movement breaks every 30 minutes**. I use **Focus Bear reminders** to stretch or do a quick walk around. I'm also more aware of how I sit now. I used to lean forward too much, and now I remind myself to lean back and relax my shoulders.

### 🔔 How I remind myself to take breaks and fix posture:

I use Focus Bear’s built-in movement reminders to pause and stretch, and I added a sticky note on my laptop that says "Straighten your back" as a quick visual reminder. These small things actually help a lot during the day.
