# Reflection: Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

---

## 1. How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

Agile ceremonies create regular, structured opportunities for the team to communicate, align, and adapt. For example:

- **Daily stand-ups** help everyone stay aware of progress, blockers, and priorities.
- **Sprint planning** ensures the team has a clear, shared understanding of what work will be done and why.
- **Retrospectives** allow teams to reflect on what went well or poorly and make continuous improvements.
- **Backlog refinement** keeps the work queue updated and prevents future sprint delays.

Together, these ceremonies build a rhythm of transparency, feedback, and coordination, even for distributed teams.

## 2. Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?

For my role, **daily stand-ups** are the most important. They give me a chance to:

- Communicate what I’ve completed and what I plan to do
- Raise blockers early so they can be resolved quickly
- Stay synced with teammates without needing long meetings

Stand-ups promote accountability and help everyone understand where the team stands each day.

## 3. One change I can make to improve my team collaboration

I will **start writing more detailed stand-up updates in Slack or async check-ins**, especially when working across time zones. This will help my teammates understand my progress and context even if we’re not online at the same time.
