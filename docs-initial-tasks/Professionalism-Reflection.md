# Reflection: Professionalism at Focus Bear

---

## 1. Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?

Yes, I’ve experienced great teamwork during a university group project where everyone was proactive, respectful, and organized. What made it effective was:

- Clear communication in a shared channel (Discord, Microsoft teams)
- Respect for each other's time and opinions
- Constructive feedback given in a calm, non-judgmental way
- Shared responsibility and trust in each team member’s contribution

The positive tone and mutual support created a productive and enjoyable environment.

- Think before responding especially when emotions are involved
- Use a friendly tone and avoid sarcasm or blunt language in written messages
- Clarify questions instead of assuming negative intent
- Use inclusive language and avoid slang or cultural references that may be unclear
- Be mindful of time zones when messaging others

## 3. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?

- Celebrate small wins and give positive feedback to teammates
- Show empathy when others are struggling
- Be responsive and reliable follow through on tasks
- Use humor appropriately without crossing professional boundaries

## 4. How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?

- Review the agenda or purpose of the meeting beforehand
- Prepare questions, updates, or blockers in advance
- Join the meeting on time and test tools (e.g., mic, camera) beforehand

## 5. What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?

- Suggest solutions when identifying problems
- Take initiative on small tasks or improvements without being asked
- Keep teammates informed of progress regularly
- Offer to help others when you have bandwidth
- Ask questions early instead of staying stuck

## 6. How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them?

How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?

- First, send a polite follow-up message after 1–2 days
- Tag the person in Discord or message them privately if it’s urgent
- If still no response after a reasonable period (3–4 days), escalate to a supervisor or project lead
- Only escalate when the delay is blocking your work or affecting the team’s progress do it respectfully and with context

## 7. What are some things you won't do?

- I won’t ignore feedback or take it personally
- I won’t push code or messages that could affect others without review
- I won’t participate in gossip or disrespectful conversations
- I won’t ghost colleagues or leave questions unanswered if I’m responsible
- I won’t speak over others or disregard quieter voices in meetings
