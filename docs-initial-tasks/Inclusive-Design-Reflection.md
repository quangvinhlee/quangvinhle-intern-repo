# üìù Inclusive Design Reflection

## How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?

I can use clear, concise, and direct language; avoid assumptions about understanding; break complex information into smaller steps; and provide written follow-ups after meetings or instructions to help with processing.

## What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

- Overcomplicated interfaces with too many features at once
- Vague instructions or unclear feedback messages
- Overloading users with notifications or distracting animations
- Using technical jargon or abstract language in communications
- Assuming everyone processes information at the same pace

## What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

I will ensure backend API error messages are clear, actionable, and user-friendly, avoiding cryptic or overly technical wording that could confuse or frustrate users. I will also document APIs with examples that highlight expected behavior clearly.
